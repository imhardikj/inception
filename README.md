We are trying to solve are waste management and clean water.

The problems we are trying to solve are waste management and clean water. Our team plans to create an app that separates out recyclable waste. It will encourage sanitation workers to collect garbage as recyclable waste has monetary value associated with it. And recycling industries will also benefit as the proposed solution can result in scaling their revenues after increasing the garbage recycling with help of automated trash categorisation (whether recyclable or not). It will reduce the required manpower and cost associated with business. Waste management is important not just for a city but oceans too because all the garbage that isnâ€™t recycled will eventually end up there. For clean water problem there are two systems that can be implemented. First is to analyse microscopic images of water and then the deep learning model can identify the type of pathogen in it. Another application is using a drone to run a surveillance check in areas of public property. The drone will pin point location that have unusual accumulation of water which results in diseases like Malaria and Dengue, etc.

Steps to run:
The first script is retrain.py
The syntax is python retrain.py --image_dir path_of_imagedir
Set the path for all the .py file
Put the same path in the start of script try-retrain.py
Then just run python try-retrain.py and image path
